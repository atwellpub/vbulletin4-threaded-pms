vbulletin4-threaded-pms
=======================

vBulletin 4 plugin for creating private message 'threaded' view. 

### Summary ###

Threaded PM system for vBulletin 4.0+ to help improve the vBulletin forum experience for administrators and users. 

This tool is now in the public domain. It needs improvement. I no longer support or develop this plugin. I will accept merge requests. Welcome to post issues. 


### Features/Benefits ###

* Turn default PM system into a 'threaded' post & reply system.
* Keep history of PM conversation in a single thread, complete with pagination controls and pm-order-sorting.
Threads and new threads are determined by PM subject title, so when new subjects are entered, new threads are created for record.
* Control/Throttle threaded PM system to increase server performance times, threads/page displays, and post/page displays.
* Superior PM Management capabilities.
* Increase in conversational efficiency.
* No additional template editing required! Everything is handled completely within the plugin!

### Needed ###

* Ability to delete threaded conversions
* Enhancements in speed for larger sites
